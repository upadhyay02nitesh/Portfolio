            <h3>Streamlined DevOps Workflow with Declarative Pipelines</h3>
            <p>
                Jul 2023 - Aug 2023<br>
                Associated with YouTube<br>
                In this project, we aim to establish an efficient and automated software delivery process by leveraging the capabilities of GitHub, AWS, Docker, and Jenkins. We will create a Declarative Pipeline that seamlessly integrates these technologies to enhance collaboration, streamline development, and ensure high-quality deployments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach involves setting up a GitHub repository to manage version control and collaboration among team members. Jenkins, a powerful automation tool, will be configured to monitor the repository for changes and trigger the Declarative Pipeline. Within the pipeline, AWS resources will be provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, and Docker will be utilized for containerization, enabling consistent and reproducible deployments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Declarative Pipeline will define stages for building, testing, and deploying applications. Testing will encompass unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks. The deployment stage will involve pushing Docker images to an AWS container registry and deploying them to a cloud infrastructure, ensuring scalability and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, we aim to establish a robust DevOps workflow that accelerates development cycles, improves collaboration, and maintains a high standard of software quality using a Declarative Pipeline integrated with GitHub, AWS, Docker, and Jenkins.
